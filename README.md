# SherwinWilliams

This is a program that I wrote for the Sherwin Williams 2020 Sales Competition. 

What it does?
The program takes in a file of 1534 different sherwin williams colors. Then the user has the ability to combine current sherwin williams colors and make a new color based off of the customers preference. The color can then be loggec by assigning a id to the customer.
